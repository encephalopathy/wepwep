All source code that contributes to the development of SHOOT EM' UP PEWPEW will be placed here.

pewpew_corona_port: The meat of the project. Contains the game's code and media required to run it.

unnecessaryfiles: extra images, sounds, and .lua files that are no longer required in the PEW!! PEW!! port, but are not yet to be deleted in case we need them again for some reason.
